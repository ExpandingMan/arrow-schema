# arrow-schema
I'm simply using this repository to store the apache arrow schema as generated
by `flatc`.  In particular, the PR for the Julia `flatc` compiler was never
merged, so it's a pain to generate Julia files.  The branch for the Julia
compiler can be found [here](https://github.com/rjkat/flatbuffers-julia).
